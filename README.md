# Site-Under-Construction-1994-Style-
This webpage was made for Cailen.net as an interim under construction page. Yes it is ugly, but I like the ugly. The first release of 
Cailen.net was heavly inspired by old dial-up websites, and terminal windows. Here, I've decided to fast foward a littlebit the release of 
CSS and the golden age of GIFS.
